# Ray Tracer

This is my Python implementation of the rendering engine described in the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://forum.raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck. The book leads the reader to gradually create a ray tracing engine by passing a series of unit tests in each chapter, leaving the chosen programming language and many implementation details up to the reader.

### Current Progress

I'm currently on chapter 7, and the engine is able to draw a sphere with some transformations and a light source. Below are a couple of photos.
